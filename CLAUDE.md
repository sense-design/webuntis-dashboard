# WebUntis Dashboard

Standalone Symfony 7 app that renders one day of WebUntis timetable data for
several students. Runs on nginx + PHP-FPM only; no database, no build step.

## Rules

- All code, comments, documentation and commit messages in English.
  User-facing strings live in `translations/<locale>.yaml`, keyed and reached
  through `App\I18n\Translator` (the `t()` Twig function). `templates/` and
  `DashboardController` hold no literal UI text in either language.
- Keep the dependency list short. Anything solvable with the standard library
  or a Symfony component already pulled in should not add a package.
- `config/untis.yaml` holds credentials and is never committed.
- CSS is plain CSS in `public/assets/style.css`. No build pipeline, no
  framework, no utility classes.

## Gotchas

- `UntisClient` takes scalar constructor arguments and must stay excluded from
  autowiring in `config/services.yaml`. It is built by `TimetableProvider`.
- WebUntis element types: 1 class, 2 teacher, 3 subject, 4 room, 5 student.
- `elemType` comes back as an int at some schools and as a string at others;
  `normaliseElementType()` handles both. Do not simplify it away.
- The parent-account child list is `children` at some schools and `students`
  at others. Both are read.
- The OTP login returns the session in a `Set-Cookie` header, not in the JSON
  body. The password login returns it in the body.
- Times arrive as integers (`800` means 08:00), dates as `Ymd` integers.
- i18n is the hand-rolled `App\I18n\Translator`, not `symfony/translation`.
  Two YAML catalogues only (`en`, `de`); keep their keys in sync. Keys are dot
  paths into the tree. The language is app-wide from `locale` in `untis.yaml`
  (`en` if unset or unknown); there is no per-request switch.
